# SuperStore Sales Analysis Project

# Overview

This project analyzes sales data from SuperStore, a retail chain, to uncover trends in sales, profitability, customer behavior, and regional performance. As a data analyst, I cleaned the dataset, transformed it for analysis, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights.

# Dataset

The dataset, SuperStore Sales DataSet.xlsx, contains 1,000+ sales records from 2019 to 2020. It includes columns such as Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Profit, Returns, Payment Mode, and additional indicators (ind1, ind2). The data spans multiple regions in the United States, covering categories like Furniture, Technology, and Office Supplies.


# Dashboard Creation in Power BI

I created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key trends and insights from the cleaned dataset. The dashboard includes:

Total Sales and Profit by Region: A bar chart showing sales and profit distribution across regions (East, West, Central, South), with the West leading in sales ($150K+).

Sales by Category and Sub-Category: A treemap illustrating sales breakdown by category (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies) and sub-category, highlighting Technology as the top performer.

Shipping Duration by Ship Mode: A line chart depicting average shipping duration for each ship mode (Same Day, First Class, Second Class, Standard Class), showing Same Day as the fastest (0 days).

Profit vs. Sales Scatter Plot: A scatter plot identifying products with high sales but low profit, such as certain Furniture items, to flag potential pricing issues.

Customer Segment Distribution: A pie chart showing the distribution of sales by customer segment (Consumer: 50%, Corporate: 30%, Home Office: 20%).

Top 10 Products by Sales: A table listing the top 10 products by sales, with "HP Designjet T520 Inkjet Large Format Printer" leading at $23,749.75.

The dashboard includes slicers for Region, Category, and Order Date, allowing users to filter and explore data interactively.

# Key Insights

Regional Performance: The West region leads in sales ($150K+) and profit ($30K+), driven by high demand for Technology products in cities like Los Angeles and Seattle.

Category Profitability: Technology products yield the highest profit margins (average 20%), while Furniture items often have lower margins or losses (e.g., Chromcraft Round Conference Tables with a -$99.35 profit).

Shipping Efficiency: Same Day shipping has the shortest duration (0 days), but Standard Class is the most used (60% of orders), indicating a balance between cost and speed.

Customer Behavior: Consumers account for 50% of sales, with Corporate clients contributing 30%. Home Office customers, though only 20%, show higher average order values.

Product Performance: High-sales items like the HP Designjet Printer ($23,749.75) also have high profits ($13,999.92), while some Furniture items (e.g., Bevis Round Bullnose Table) result in losses despite decent sales.

Interesting Fact: Despite Technology being the top category, Office Supplies have the highest order frequency (40% of orders), driven by small, frequent purchases like paper and binders, suggesting a steady demand for essentials.

These insights demonstrate my ability to extract meaningful patterns and trends from complex datasets, a core skill for a data analyst.
